## CSharp
What is a literal value?
A literal value is a constant value that never changes. Previously, you displayed a literal string to the output console. In other words, you literally wanted that string of alphanumeric characters H, e, l, l, o, and so on, displayed in the output console.

Use the string data type whenever you have alphanumeric words, phrases, or data for presentation, not calculation. What other kinds of literal data can you print to output?

##  Data Types
1-char literals  
2-int Literals  
3-Floating point Literals(float,double,decimal)  
4-Boolean Literal  
##  Here's a few important considerations about variable names:

Variable names can contain alphanumeric characters and the underscore character. Special characters like the hash symbol # (also known as the number symbol or pound symbol) or dollar symbol $ are not allowed.  
Variable names must begin with an alphabetical letter or an underscore, not a number.  
Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning that string Value; and string value; are two different variables.  
Variable names must not be a C# keyword. For example, you cannot use the following variable declarations: decimal decimal; or string string;.
